What this tutorial is, and what it is not
-

What it is:

* __An introduction to game development using Panda3D.__ It will teach the basic principles of the engine, and techniques for using it--enough to make a simple game.

	Indeed, over the course of these lessons we'll build up exactly that: a basic arena-based, top-down score-shooter. If the genre of the game isn't to your tastes, that's fair enough: it's merely an example--a lens through which to teach Panda3D. The principles taught with it should apply to a wide variety of game-types (even non-action games).

What it is not:

* __A Python tutorial.__ This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of Python (and ideally of object-oriented programming). You don't have to be an expert, but if you're entirely new to the language then I recommend picking up a Python tutorial before taking on this one!

* __A game design tutorial.__ The game built up in these lessons is intended to teach the basics of Panda3D, rather than to be a great game. (Although I do think that it is somewhat fun.) Furthermore, the focus is on teaching the use of Panda3D--while there will be some mention of game design, I intend to somewhat skim over it.

* __An advanced Panda3D Tutorial.__ Panda3D is capable of much more than is shown here: advanced physics, custom shaders, complex logic, and more besides!

What's covered:
-

* The fundamentals of Panda3D
* Lights and automatic shading
* Input-handling
* Tasks and "update" methods
* Simple collision-detection
* Music and sound effects
* GUI construction
* Building a distributable version
* And more besides!

Reference code:
-

Each lesson provides example code--but these are often fragments (for brevity's sake). If you want to see the code in context, compare it with your own, you can find the full code as of the end of each lesson in the "ReferenceCode" directory. In there you should find one directory for each lesson, containing the full code 

The assets included, and what you're allowed to do with them
-

This tutorial includes various assets used in the game that it builds up; they should all be found in the "Assets" folder. These come from a variety of sources, and fall under a variety of licenses.

If you're just using this tutorial to learn how to use Panda3D, with no intention of distributing any of it, then I doubt that you have to worry about this.

If you intend to use any of the included assets in a manner that involves distributing them--even for free--then you may want to check the license file to see what requirements or restrictions may apply. For example, some assets may be used commercially, while others may not--and almost all require some form of attribution or linking.

The license file is named "license.txt", and should contain fuller information, and links where appropriate.

However, note that I am not a lawyer, and that none of this is legal advice.

And now, let us begin...
